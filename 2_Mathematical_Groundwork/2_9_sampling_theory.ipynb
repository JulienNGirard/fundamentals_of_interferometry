    "Our goal in radio interferometry is to produce a map of the sky by sampling a finite number of spatial frequency modes present in its spectrum (this will become clearer as the course unfolds). By sampling only a discrete number of frequency modes we are effectively turning a continuous problem into a discrete one. Recall that at the end of the last section we saw some peculiarities in the output of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). In particular we note the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * That there were non-zero components $Y_k$ at frequencies which were not present in the input signal.\n",
    "   * That the amplitudes of the $Y_k$ corresponding to the frequencies present in the input signal were not all equal dispite the fact that they are the same in the input signal.\n",
    "   * That is was not possible to find the frequencies present in the input signal when $N$ (the number of samples) was below a certain number. \n",
    "\n",
    "These features will, in some form or another, also be present in radio interferometry. The aim of this section is to develop an intuitive understanding of why the above features are present in the discrete spectrum. In doing so we will discuss aliasing, the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem (or just sampling theorem for short), impulse response and deconvolution. A proper understanding of these topics will allow us to answer questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Given the (effective) diameter of a telescope, what is the maximum pixel size we can choose for the reconstructed image?\n",
    "* Which of the features in the reconstructed image are real features corresponding to the sky and which are artificial features introduced by sampling only a limited number of frequency modes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, in interferometry, we are sampling in the spatial frequency domain. Unfortunately, our intuition does not extend as easily to this domain. We are more inclined to think of the world in terms of a sequence of events i.e. in the time domain. A similar statement is true in interferometry. Our intuition extends more easily to the image domain than to its spectral dual. As a result we will start this section by considering sampling in the time domain and look at the implications it has for the frequency domain."

    "Hopefully, you will have noticed that the information contained in $Y_k$ is very sensitive to the sampling interval $\\Delta t$. The Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem explains why it is not possible to recover the frequency information contained in a signal when the sampling becomes too course i.e. $\\Delta t$ is too large or $N$ is too small. One way to state the theorem is that, when sampling a signal at an interval $\\Delta t$ (equivalently a frequency of $f_s = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t}$), it is not possible to recover any frequency information above a frequency of $f_N = \\frac{1}{2\\Delta t}$. We call $f_N$ the *Nyquist frequency*. In the above example we kept the sampling interval fixed. Thus, by decreasing $N$, we increase the width of the sampling interval $\\Delta t$ and hence decrease $f_N$. This explains the seemingly erratic behaviour of $|Y_k|$ as $N \\rightarrow 0$. Note that, at $f_1 = 1$Hz, $f_2 = 2$Hz and $f_3 = 3$Hz, the input frequencies remain the same. Decreasing $N$ below a certain limit therefore results in a value of $f_N$ less than the maximum frequency present in the signal. Proving the sampling theorem is trivial once the Poisson summation formula has been established. Recall that the periodic summation of the spectrum $Y(f)$ of the (Schwartz) function $y(t)$ is related to the Fourier series components of $y_n = \\Delta t y(n \\Delta t)$ according to "
