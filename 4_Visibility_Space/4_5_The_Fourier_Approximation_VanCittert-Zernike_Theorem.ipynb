Using this information, we demonstrate how the shape and the position of a source could be accurately measured by interferometry ($\\S$ 4.3.2).\n",

They take the form of elliptical path which can potentially enrich the $uv$ plane. The more diversified and numerous are the samples in the $uv$ plane, the better the knowledge of the visibility function. In order to improves the $uv$ coverage, we presented in [$\\S$ 4.4.2 &#10142;](4_4_2_UV_Coverage_Improving_Your_Coverage.ipynb) three different ways that increase the number of samples.\n",
